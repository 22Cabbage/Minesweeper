# Minesweeper
In this assignment, you will create a game like [Minesweeper](https://youtu.be/MPKXNLkDz10), as a class. Your game board should be 10x10, with a score displayed, a restart button (the smiley face), and a timer. View the video above for the rules of the game. This is a group project, so you, as a class, will hand in one copy of this assignment. Each student will be responsible to complete functions of the assignment that contributes to the overall assignment. You will be required to use the [discussion board](https://npsc.elearningontario.ca/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=11974765&type=discuss&rcode=eLO-18841663) for the assignment so that I can see who is doing what. Also, be sure to comment in each function or block of code who is responsible for creating it.

## You will be required to create the following:
As a group project, you will be required to work as a team to develop the program. Also, as part of a team, you will be required to do your share of the work and contribute to the project. In order for me to be witness to this group effort, communication for the assignment will need to be on the [discussion board](https://npsc.elearningontario.ca/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=11974765&type=discuss&rcode=eLO-18841663) for this assignment. You are required to contribute to the discussion needed to complete the assignment. This can be as simple as offering to create a certain function of the game, or something as complex as solving a critical problem that involves direct application of programming paradigms.
